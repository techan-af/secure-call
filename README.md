# Secure Call

Secure Call is a real-time, secure voice calling application designed to facilitate peer-to-peer audio communication with enhanced security and scam detection features. This project integrates modern web technologies to record and process calls, transcribe audio in multiple languages, and utilize advanced AI (Gemini AI) to analyze call content for potential scam indicators.

## Overview

Secure Call provides a secure platform for real-time voice communication. With an emphasis on user security and call integrity, the application:

- Uses *WebRTC* for establishing peer-to-peer audio calls
- Implements *Socket.IO* for real-time signaling, user presence, and call control
- Records calls in 15-second segments and uploads them to *Cloudinary*
- Converts audio recordings using *FFmpeg* and transcribes them using the *Google Speech-to-Text API* in multiple languages
- Leverages *Google Generative AI (Gemini AI)* to refine transcriptions and perform an in-depth scam analysis based on a set of predefined scam detection flags
- Persists call recordings and analysis results in *MongoDB*

## Features

### Real-Time Communication
Secure voice calls between users are established using WebRTC with seamless signaling via Socket.IO.

### Call Recording & Chunking
Calls are automatically recorded in 15-second chunks to enable incremental processing and transcription.

### Audio Upload & Processing
Each audio chunk is uploaded to Cloudinary, then downloaded and converted to WAV format using FFmpeg. The WAV file is then transcribed using the Google Speech-to-Text API.

### Refined Transcription & Scam Analysis
Raw transcriptions are refined using Gemini AI. The refined text is analyzed for common scam indicators such as fake authority claims, urgent or fear tactics, and requests for sensitive information.

### User Presence & Signaling
Real-time updates on online users are maintained using heartbeat pings, ensuring active user status for call initiation.

### Comprehensive UI
The frontend, built with React, provides an intuitive interface featuring a bottom navigation for switching between screens (Call, Call Logs, Fraud News, Scam Awareness).

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- *React:* Library for building the user interface
- *React Router:* For navigation between different screens
- *Material-UI (MUI):* UI component library for the bottom navigation and other elements
- *Lucide-React:* Icon library for sleek and modern icons
- *Socket.IO Client:* For establishing real-time communication with the backend
- *WebRTC:* For peer-to-peer audio call capabilities

### Backend
- *Node.js & Express:* Server-side runtime and framework for REST API development
- *Socket.IO:* Real-time bidirectional communication between the server and clients
- *MongoDB & Mongoose:* NoSQL database for storing call recordings and analysis data
- *Axios:* HTTP client for making requests to external APIs
- *FFmpeg (via fluent-ffmpeg):* Audio conversion tool for processing call recordings
- *Cloudinary:* Cloud service for uploading and storing audio files
- *Google Speech-to-Text API:* Service for transcribing audio recordings
- *Google Generative AI (Gemini AI):* AI service for refining transcriptions and analyzing call content for scam indicators

## Architecture & Workflow

1. *User Registration & Presence*
   - Each user is assigned a unique ID upon connection
   - The client sends periodic heartbeat messages to the backend using Socket.IO
   - The backend maintains a list of active users and cleans up stale entries

2. *Call Initiation & Signaling*
   - Users can initiate calls by selecting an online user from the list
   - WebRTC handles peer-to-peer audio streams while Socket.IO exchanges signaling data (offers, answers, and ICE candidates)

3. *Call Recording & Chunking*
   - Active calls are recorded in 15-second chunks using the MediaRecorder API
   - Each chunk is uploaded to Cloudinary for storage and subsequent processing

4. *Audio Processing & Transcription*
   - The backend downloads the recorded audio from Cloudinary
   - FFmpeg converts the audio from WebM to WAV format
   - The Google Speech-to-Text API transcribes the audio in multiple languages (e.g., en-US and en-IN)

5. *Refinement & Scam Analysis*
   - Raw transcriptions are sent to Gemini AI for refinement
   - An analysis is performed against predefined scam flags (e.g., fake authority, urgency, sensitive information requests)
   - A comprehensive analysis report, including scam likelihood and detailed flag violations, is generated

6. *Data Persistence*
   - Call recordings, transcriptions, refined transcriptions, and scam analysis reports are saved in MongoDB

## Usage

### Initiating a Call
Upon launching the app, you will see your unique user ID along with a list of online users. Click on the Call button next to a user's name to initiate a call.

### Receiving a Call
If another user calls you, an incoming call notification appears with options to Answer or Decline.

### Call In-Progress
During a call, audio is recorded in 15-second intervals. Each chunk is processed to provide real-time transcription and refined analysis. The transcript and refined transcript (including scam analysis) are displayed within the application.

### Ending a Call
To end a call, click the End Call button. The call termination signal is sent, and all media streams are closed. The final chunk (if any) is processed and added to the cumulative transcript.
